                SDG 13: CLIMATE ACTION


PROBLEM DEFINITION: Analyze how greenhouse gas concentrations (CO2, CH4, N2O) affect global temperatures over time.



Greenhouse gases including CO2, CH4, among others, are increasing and enhancing climate change. 
Countries will mitigate climate change only if they monitor and reduce such kinds of emissions. 
The project shall look to analyze and visualize data on greenhouse gas emissions, showing tendencies and how they affect
